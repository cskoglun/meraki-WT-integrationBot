## Motivation

Include a short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project.  Explain **why** the project exists.

This code is the reference to the "Program your network to work for you" webinar. 

main.py is the brain behind a Webex Teams bot that integrates with a Meraki Network. The goal of the bot is to outsource the taks of creating, deleting and managing SSID:s from a network engineer to the receptionst of the company. However, the code itself can be adjusted after your own needs (adjust functions, messages etc.). See it more as a framework to get started with creating Bots, integrating with other systems and learning how to leverage APIs to do that. Enjoy!
